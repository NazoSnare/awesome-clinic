# Awesome Clinic app
assessment to showcase my skill level.

## Prerequisites
- expo cli
- react native
- nodejs
- npm 

# how to run

1. ```
     cd into folder
   ```
2.  ```
     npm run install 
    ```
2.  ```
     npm run android
    ```


 ## folder structures
The structures below allow for easier reuse of code and ensuring uniformity amongst apps of the same nature
- src/components : houses the components
- src/screens : has the view or the screen layout 
- utils : utility functions for reuse and redux setup...

## components
- index.js - logic and functionality of the component
- xx.styles.js - styles for the component for easier reuse throughout
- xx.test.js - test file for the unit testing of the components
The idea is to test the individual components and the screens to not have any logic. As seen above

# I have uncommented the test file code as It had been long since using react native and I see now that some of the functionalities and libraries have updated and some codes deprecated...however it is nothing one can't be familiar with in a day.
